The Gaming Room
Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements
The Gaming Room needed a software solution to manage multiplayer online games, particularly one similar to their existing game, Draw It or Lose It. They required a scalable and maintainable system that could efficiently manage multiple games while preventing duplicate instances. A key requirement was implementing the singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of GameService existed.

Strengths in Documentation Development
One aspect I did well was structuring the documentation with clear UML diagrams and detailed class descriptions. This made it easier to visualize relationships between components and ensured that the design aligned with the client's specifications. Additionally, I maintained consistency in naming conventions and class responsibilities, making the documentation easier to follow.

Most Helpful Part of the Design Document
Creating a structured design document helped translate abstract requirements into concrete implementations. Defining attributes, methods, and class relationships beforehand reduced the risk of structural issues during coding. It also allowed me to identify potential improvements before writing actual code, saving time in debugging and refactoring.

Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise one part, I would refine the explanations of class interactions, particularly between GameService, Game, Team, and Player. Expanding on use cases and adding more examples would make it clearer how objects interact within the system. Additionally, improving the documentation on edge cases would help future developers anticipate potential issues.

Understanding and Implementing User Needs
I ensured the design aligned with user expectations by focusing on efficiency, scalability, and uniqueness in game management. Implementing the singleton pattern in GameService addressed the need for centralized game tracking. Considering user needs is crucial in software development to create a system that is both functional and user-friendly, reducing unnecessary complexity while maintaining flexibility for future expansions.

Software Design Approach and Future Strategies
My approach involved analyzing the requirements, mapping out the system structure with UML diagrams, and defining clear class responsibilities. In the future, I would integrate more iterative feedback loops to refine the design early on. Additionally, employing test-driven development (TDD) and solidifying error handling mechanisms would further improve the robustness of similar projects.
